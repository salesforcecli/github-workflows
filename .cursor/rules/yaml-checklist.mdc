In github worklows that run shell scripts or use `script`, refer to inputs and outputs via the environment variable convention.
ex: there is an input named `githubTag`.
BAD: `RESPONSE=$(npm view .@${{ inputs.githubTag }} version --json --silent || echo "Not published")`
GOOD: `RESPONSE=$(npm view .@$INPUTS_GITHUB_TAG version --json --silent || echo "Not published")`
BAD: `echo "published said ${{ steps.is-published.outputs.published }}"`
GOOD: `echo "[INFO] Is package published:\ $STEPS_IS_PUBLISHED_PUBLISHED"`
It's OK to use ${{ foo }} outside of shell script (`run:`) blocks and outside of `script`
