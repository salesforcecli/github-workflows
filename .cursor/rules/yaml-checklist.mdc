Moving stuff to Environment Variables for safer scripting
ex: there is an input named `githubTag`. Add an `ENV:` to it like `INPUTS_GITHUB_TAG: ${{ inputs.githubTag }}`

### shell scripts

In github worklows that run shell scripts refer to inputs and outputs via the environment variable convention.
BAD: `RESPONSE=$(npm view .@${{ inputs.githubTag }} version --json --silent || echo "Not published")`
GOOD: `RESPONSE=$(npm view .@$INPUTS_GITHUB_TAG version --json --silent || echo "Not published")`

### script tag

when using `script` from actions/github-script
BAD: `script: core.setFailed("The version '$INPUTS_GITHUB_TAG' has already been published to npm")`
GOOD: `script: core.setFailed(`The version '${process.env.INPUTS_GITHUB_TAG}' has already been published to npm`)`

It's OK to use ${{ foo }} outside of shell script (`run:`) blocks and outside of `script` (example if: statements on a job)
